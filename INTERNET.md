# What is the internet?

The internet is a network of computers just like your wifi.
Every computer has one or more address and network ports.

You can imagine a city, every building in the city is a computer.
Addresses are like building adresses.
Ports are like dorbells or postboxes in that building.

Usually ports have special meanings:

 - 80  - http / traditionally for websites
 - 443 - https / "secure" http
